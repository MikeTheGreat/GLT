; All configuration info that's specific to a class goes into
; a section for that class
; This should be lower-case (bit142 not BIT142)
; GLT will lower-case any arguments so you can type whatever you want
; on the command line

; This file is where students' account info is stored
; This is important because GitLab wants us to ask for stuff by ID
; and it appears to be difficult to get objects any other way
; This file is basically a class list/roster
; WARNING:	Please don't put this into the 'defaults' section or else
;			you'll use a single class list file for all the classes :)
