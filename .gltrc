; This is the .gitrc file.  It contains config info for GLT.
; 

[defaults]
; GLT will prefix server_ip with "http://" to access the web api
; and will use it itself to clone via ssh
;server_ip=gitlab1.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/
server_ip=192.168.56.101

username=root
password=mikemike ; this can (and should) be specified on the command line

; data_dir stores data files, one for each section
; The files themselves are given a name that includes the section
data_dir=E:\Work\Tech_Research\Git\Misc\Data\

; A temporary directory where GLT can write/read
; files temporarily (for example, in order to merge
; a local project into a project on the GitLab server)
temp_dir=e:\Work\Tech_Research\Git\Temp\

[bit142]
; All configuration info that's specific to a class goes into
; a section for that class
; This should be lower-case (bit142 not BIT142)
; GLT will lower-case any arguments so you can type whatever you want
; on the command line

; This file is where students' account info is stored
; This is important because GitLab wants us to ask for stuff by ID
; and it appears to be difficult to get objects any other way
; This file is basically a class list/roster
; WARNING:	Please don't put this into the 'defaults' section or else
;			you'll use a single class list file for all the classes :)
