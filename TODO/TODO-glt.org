* Bugs
** NEXT Verify that all paged results are being processed using page-aware code
*** Pages should start with page 1 (apparently page 0 duplicates page 1 - HW download code ran into this)

*** Why the f does 'download' not know when things are new?
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ARCHIVE_TIME: 2016-12-19 Mon 13:01
    :END:
**** Because it's only comparing whether a 'pull' changes things.  Need to switch this to looking for the previous instructor commit message / tag
**** GradeList is case-sensitive on the assignment (PCE_10 works, but pce_10 doesn't?) 
*** download doesn't grab BIT 142 new projects (like Garth's)?

**** GLT wasn't getting paged data
* Features:
** NEXT Delete all student accounts (and their projects) from GitLab
*** Delete students' projects when deleting their acounts
	 TODO: Figure out how this could even work - how do we find their projects?
		 Projects appear to have a 'forked from' field somewhere.  We could keep the ID of the original project
			 and then delete anything that's forked from it
		 Projects have a 'created by' field - maybe 

** 'Verbose' mode for GitDo, download, etc, so that it's clear which repos we're working on?
** List all homeworks
** List all students in a class
** List all config options, and where they came from?
** Verify GitLab setup
*** Student projects don't allow pull requests, etc
*** Starter project's "forks" link (left column) does NOT list other students' proejcts?
**** Or else they're inaccessible?
*** create users: there's an 'external' option for accounts: 
**** "External users cannot see internal or private projects unless access is explicitly granted. Also, external users cannot create projects or groups."
** Add a 'check environment' option?  
	This can check for gitlab access, local git installed, ssh keys set up, etc?
	Could try to create a project on GitLab, then create a local repo, then push/pull?

 from https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-merge:
 *Warning*: Running git merge with non-trivial uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.
 It looks like things should be fine AS LONG AS the instructor and student don't change each other's files (i.e., as long as there are no merge conflicts)

* Improvements / Polish
** argparse can't group subparsers - create help description that groups them instead?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32017020/grouping-argparse-subparser-arguments

** Move GitLabUtils into CourseInfo object

** HomeworkDescs aren't being sorted correctly, are they (no comparison method?)
** Upload feedback
*** DONE How to make this idempotent? SPLIT THIS INTO TWO COMMANDS - COMMIT FEEDBACK AND UPLOAD FEEDBACK
    CLOSED: [2016-09-18 Sun 22:32]
    Specifically, how to let instructors check in & tag stuff, then later on upload it?
    (Can I have call_shell continue on error (instead of exiting?))
*** Verify that students can't permenantly destroy feedback
**** (i.e., even if deleted it will remain in the project's history)
**** Verify that this will be true even if git-gc is run after deleting the file
*** FAQ about telling students not to delete the GLT tags (which they /will/ be able to do)

** Look at '--porcelain' option for parsing by scripts (and plumbing commands?)
** downloadHomework needs some work
*** When an assignment is not found, list all the ones that are present in the data file
*** print the section and homework(s) that it's attempting to download
*** freshen anything that's already there: log is separately from new downloads?
*** Log existing, unfreshened dirs?
** When downloading, print out dots to indicate that progress is being made
*** Otherwise it just sits there for a while, then spews the summary
** Use Python-standard temp. dir functionality
*** https://docs.python.org/2/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.mkdtemp
**** It looks like this will create a temp dir for me (instead of me having to find a directory to use) but I still have to get rid of it
*** add a 'clean_temp' function to delete dir & everything in it
*** Always do this at the end of the program
** Have download suggest commitFeedback, which suggests uploadFeedback
** Would it be easier just to pass an array of command line parts to gitDo?  Instead of having git_do_core wrap multi-word args with quotes, and then have call_shell rebuild it?
** NEED: GitDo needs to gracefully handle non-existent commands (e.g., missing .bat file)
** Double check if any print_color(RED) should actually be print_error()

** grep for os.sep & replace with os.path.join

** Remove 'Utils' from all the files' names
** Do all options need section / homework assign?  If so let's factor that out...
** If GLT adds a project but doesn't add that project to the course data file the project is lost - bullet-proof this?
* Needed docs
** Setting up GitLab
*** Email sending - SendGrid
*** TimeZone
https://www.borngeek.com/2015/02/27/setting-the-time-zone-in-gitlab/
** Setup Azure
*** Modify to use SendGrid
*** Pre-configured VMs: https://about.gitlab.com/2016/07/13/how-to-setup-a-gitlab-instance-on-microsoft-azure/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=marketo&utm_campaign=release+newsletter&utm_content=july+22+2016&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTnpBM01EY3lOekkzWW1NMiIsInQiOiJiR2pZNmk1MCtZOVYrTjVpN2xISTBaeUZEaXczSnI3VFZqVUxkM1hPVUlUSFhHVHl6TnpXSVlxYUZPYzN0OU12OXpHeGtwS3FIaTdKeHZLd2QxXC9UZEcrT08xcHVOQ2dpREM3MVNpNlNKSDQ9In0%3D
** Debugging advice?
*** How to adjust the logging level
*** Try it on the command line, then use gitdo
** Create a 'walkthrough doc', with code examples to copy (instead of having this at the bottom of glt.py)
** DOCUMENT: How to connect to GitLab server via ssh
   (in glt_install.md)
** Add more documentation (commenting) in the .gitlabrc file
	Note that I can add command line options to override if needed/wanted

** Create students for a class: DOCUMENT THIS
	document that the name, username, password, and email are all required by GitLab

** Delete students for a class: DOCUMENT THIS

** Add homework

** Download homework
** Commit feedback
*** Specifically, this should be done before calling download homework again
** Upload Feedback
** GradingList
** GitDo   
* Tests
** Figure out testing strategy
** Draw up test plan
* Future Options
** Would putting the class projects into a group make it easier for the students to find all the projects?
** Look into WebHooks in order to lock down GitLab
	[Students add each other to a project they created, unless I can do something about this :(]
	WebHooks are poorly documented and seem to only apply to commits, issues, and tags
	[[Maybe write a routine to verify that students have not shared their projects with anyone?]]

** Kanban cards?

** Ansible/Chef for setting up the server?
** How to distribute?
*** pip package? app/executable?
		 https://hynek.me/articles/sharing-your-labor-of-love-pypi-quick-and-dirty/	
		 https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/	
		 https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/
		 https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/
*** Ansible/Chef recipe?
*** PyInstaller?
    http://www.pyinstaller.org/
 
** Create a forum for people to ask questions about GLT?

** Possibly use pygit2, or dulwich, or python-git instead of parsing command-line git calls?

*** https://www.dulwich.io/docs/tutorial/repo.html

	Merge starter project into (empty) server project & push back to server


** DONE how to idempotently allow for a HW project to be added 
   CLOSED: [2016-09-10 Sat 22:33]

*** Verify that this is working :)

*** In Course_Info.create_homework, when we try to create a HW assignmnet and fail (because it's already there) then go look it up so that we can try to (re-)add students to it



** DONE call_git should confirm success
   CLOSED: [2016-09-10 Sat 22:30]

** DONE: Iron out IP issue with Cascadia
** DONE: Create students: Go back and add them to any assignments that have been created for the course
** DONE: Input files: lastname, firstname - STILL A BUG??
** DONE: double check that students can sign themselves out of a group
	YEP, THEY SURE CAN
	In which case we DO need the local list of who's in a class
	We could probably assume that any projects in that group are homework assignments, though
** DONE: Change from known good list file EnvVar to a directory that we control
	Use it for KGL, list of homework assignments, etc

	Add env. variable
	open a file based on the section
	Test CourseInfo ctor
	Return courseInfo (instead of student_list)

	add 'write to file' method to CourseInfo
	Test that it works
** DONE: Delete students from a class
** DONE: Create a printError function
	with colors
	to stderr
** DONE: Double-check that I'm checking for stuff in env by using "key in env"
** DONE: Double-check the subparser stuff
** DONE: Can I use a parent parser for handling the common args?
** DONE: Switch argparser to using subparsers instead of piles of optional args
** DONE: Create a 'load_student_list' function, to load students from file
** DONE: Create 'LoadEnv' function
	have parser print & exit when asked for help
	if section parameter is present just load the lkg list
	return the env & known_good accounts list
	DONE: enum for env names
** DONE: Create students for a class
	read student list from file
		DONE: modify the csv_reader to accept 3 or 4 columns
			specify 3 vs.4 columns with an enum: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1695250/250610 
			throw an exception in 4-col (Internal) mode when missing 4th column
				Maybe have an error message that includes details of how to fix the file?
					I.e., either remove the offending line, or else lookup the ID**
		Use csv module to read/write internal files?
				these don't seem to support removal of comments
				Could I subclass File & strip comments out of the stream?
				=== Resolved: It'll be more work than benefit

	read KnownGoodAccounts file
		find duplicates, move them into the 'error' pile
	attempt to create student accounts
		move students into 'error' pile as they occur
	foreach error:
		print the error
	foreach good:
		re-write the KnownGoodAccounts file with the new info
		Name of this file should be specified in .gitlabrc
** DONE: Replace StudentsFromFile with a NamedTuple
	** from https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/collections.html**collections.namedtuple 
** DONE: Figure out how to roll up errors / success messages
	StudentCollection now has ok/notOk lists, we'll move from one to the other
	as they move through the 'pipeline' and errors are encountered

	VS integration
	Selenium/WebDriver integration (done for chrome)
** DONE: Check: Can I create a GitLab account without an email address?
	NOPE :(	
** DONE: Fix PyLint warnings?

 		Nope - I'll just switch this back & forth as I test
** DONE: Remove the map thingee/kwargs
    	(messed up intellisense, notæ really useful itself)
** DONE: modify CSV reader to ignore '#....' comments, so we can put error messages into them
** DONE: Setup Azure, Install GitLab
** DONE: Add a command-line option for listing the projects
** DONE: command line integrated with (and overrides) rcfile
** DONE: config file to store lots of options
       use rcfile - once for the 'defaults' section, 
           then again for a given class (if specified)
** DONE: CLI cmd-line args
** DONE: Use the built-in Python map intead of the IterateOver____?  No - the improvement isn't immense, and what we've got works
** DONE: How to set up teacher project & student projects and/or have fork the teacher copy into the student groups?
** DONE: Figure out how to get the GitLab server to send email (SendGrid?)

** RETURN TO LATER (?):
 https://github.com/docopt/docopt
       from docopt import docopt
       Can I do substitution/interpolation of the 'glt.py' in the docstring?
* Notes
** List of porcelain commands with --porcelain option
git status --porcelain

git blame --porcelain
git commit --porcelain
git worktree list --porcelain
* Research topic ideas
** Possible paper
*** Automates tedious, error-prone instructor work
*** Previous work has verified that students get benefits from this
**** Particularly valuable in CS1/CS2
*** General approach: smaller claims are easier to verify
*** current state: looking for people who want to use it
*** TODO GLT Research paper deadlines: mid-to-late April for CCSC workshop; summer deadline for SIGCSE
** Using metrics to impact student success?
