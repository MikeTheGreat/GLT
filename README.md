# GitLabTool (GLT) #

This software was made possible by the support from [Cascadia Community College](http://www.cascadia.edu).

**This software is 'pre-alpha' software.**  The features are mostly done, 
it worked on my machine when I tested it by hand, but it's not ready
for use by other people yet.
